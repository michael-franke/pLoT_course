# The probabilistic Language of Thought: A course

Materials for a course on the Language of Thought, covering the topic from a theoretical and practical point of view.

> **_NOTE:_**  This repo contains a jupyter-book. There are two intended usages:

1. Use as a jupyter-book directly. For instance, copy-paste code snippets.
2. Use the notebooks in jupyter colab. Each notebook installs the required packages (i.e. Piantadosi's LOTlib3). The chapters (notebooks) can be imported directly from the repo into colab.
